# This file is part of the rubiks-examples, an example rubiks repository to help
# show how rubiks could be used

# In this file, we store variants of different variables used by the config and called by
# doing the import_python("lookup.kube", "get_variant") and then a subsequent get_variant().
# The variant call allows us to choose whether or not to split by cluster, so we can have
# variables that are the same across all clusters, or different on each
